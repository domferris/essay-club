      Everything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of deeply felt needs and the
      assuagement of pain. One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and
      their development. Feeling and longing are the motive force behind all human endeavor and human creation, in however
      exalted a guise the latter may present themselves to us. Now what are the feelings and needs that have led men to
      religious thought and belief in the widest sense of the words? A little consideration will suffice to show us that
      the most varying emotions preside over the birth of religious thought and experience. With primitive man it is above
      all fear that evokes religious notions - fear of hunger, wild beasts, sickness, death. Since at this stage of
      existence understanding of causal connections is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates illusory beings
      more or less analogous to itself on whose wills and actions these fearful happenings depend. Thus one tries to
      secure the favor of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which, according to the tradition
      handed down from generation to generation, propitiate them or make them well disposed toward a mortal. In this sense
      I am speaking of a religion of fear. This, though not created, is in an important degree stabilized by the formation
      of a special priestly caste which sets itself up as a mediator between the people and the beings they fear, and
      erects a hegemony on this basis. In many cases a leader or ruler or a privileged class whose position rests on other
      factors combines priestly functions with its secular authority in order to make the latter more secure; or the
      political rulers and the priestly caste make common cause in their own interests.

      The social impulses are another source of the crystallization of religion. Fathers and mothers and the leaders of
      larger human communities are mortal and fallible. The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the
      social or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence, who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes; the
      God who, according to the limits of the believer's outlook, loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of the
      human race, or even or life itself; the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied longing; he who preserves the souls of
      the dead. This is the social or moral conception of God.

      The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a
      development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the
      Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in
      peoples' lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples
      purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions
      are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion
      of morality predominates.

      Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals
      of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this
      level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely
      found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to
      anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it.
    </p>

      The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal
      themselves both in nature and in the world of thought. Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he
      wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already
      appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism,
      as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma
      and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence
      it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious
      feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in
      this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite
      notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this
      feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thus arrive at a conception of the relation of science to religion very different from the usual one. When one
      views the matter historically, one is inclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists, and
      for a very obvious reason. The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation
      cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events - provided, of course, that
      he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for
      social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's
      actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more
      than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been charged with
      undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy,
      education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had
      to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees.On the other
      hand, I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research. Only
      those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science
      cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from
      the immediate realities of life, can issue. What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and what a
      yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must
      have had to enable them to spend years of
      solitary labor in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics! Those whose acquaintance with scientific
      research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of
      the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world
      and through the centuries. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what
      has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures.
      It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this
      materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.
